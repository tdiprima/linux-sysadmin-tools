Setting up passwordless SSH manually for 5 servers would mean:

- SSH'ing into each one individually
- Creating the .ssh directory if needed
- Copying your public key
- Setting all the correct permissions
- Testing each connection...

That's easily 15-20 minutes of repetitive work (and potential for typos!) condensed into a single script that runs in under a minute. Plus, the script handles all the edge cases like checking if the key already exists, verifying the connection works, and giving you a nice summary at the end.
